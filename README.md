# direwolf
A Vim colorscheme, inspired to some extent by Steve Losh's [{bad,good}wolf](https://github.com/sjl/badwolf).

I wanted a light colorscheme that mostly fit in with the Apple OS X aesthetic and which only provided very simple syntax highlighting, so here it is.

GUI-only for now.  If you want to use it in a terminal and you're lazy - like me - then you can just use [this plugin](https://github.com/godlygeek/csapprox) to make it look about right.
